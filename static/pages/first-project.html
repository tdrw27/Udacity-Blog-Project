        <h2>Start to Finish</h2>
        <p>This is the first project that I have completed that I can say <strong>I am proud</strong> of. I know it is not much, and on the outside it may not seem impressive, but learning to manage the changing state of a program was a fun challenge. If you want to play the game, you will need <strong>DrRacket</strong> and to copy and paste the code into the definitions area. Run the program with <i class="highlight">(main G0)</i>.</p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>In my opinion, one of the biggest challenges with making a program is staying on task. After you have been creating functions and realizing the mountain of additional function and data definitions you could possibly need, the task can begin to feel daunting.</p>

        <h2>What I've Learned</h2>
        <p>The main takeaway I learned was being to <strong>work methodically</strong> through the design of the program. Being able to break big problems down into manageable steps makes it seem like the difficulty of a task never gets too out of hand. Being able to contiue working away at smaller problems will inevitably progress you toward the goal. That feeling is something I have only felt while programming, however, that method can be applied to almost any aspect of problem solving.</p>

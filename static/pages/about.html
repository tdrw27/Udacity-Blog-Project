        <p>Through my discovery of finding my love for programming, I have also discovered many challenges. With the challenges, however, comes the joy with overcoming the trials in front of you. To me, that is one of the greatest things I have learned. Continuing to push yourself and <strong>never giving up</strong>, even when it feels like you are not understading or not making progress, was one of the most important things I have learned in my life. One thing that always seemed to haunt me was constantly comparing my work to work I see online. Understanding that I only need to get better than I was yesterday is what keeps me going.</p>

        <p>I first started my learning journey learning JavaScript and Racket. I used a variety of different sources and  found out many things about programming. One struggle I ran into was starting one resource and then switching to another when I would get stuck. It works but progress stalls <strong>immensely</strong>. I would recommend anyone in my position to look elsewhere for different if stuck, but try to keep working through the same program all the way to the end. </p>

        <p>My goal is to transisiton careers from <em class="highlight">truck driver</em> to <em class="highlight">developer</em>. I have finally found the passion and courage needed to strive for this goal. I made a promise to myself that I will not stop working toward this no matter the difficulties that lie ahead. If you've read all this way through, I want to say thank you for giving me the time and I wish you good luck in your current endeavours! <strong>Take care!</strong></p>
